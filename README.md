I've learned a range of topics like user authentication, data, validation, asynchronous JavaScript, password hashing, Express, MongoDB, templating engines, maintaining user sessions and more.

# Chapter 1: Introduction
We will build a blog app which lets users write blog entries once they sign up with an account.

## Benefits of NodeJS
* Firstly, the V8 JavaScript engine used in Google Chrome is fast and can execute thousands of instructions a second.
* Secondly, Node.js encourages an asynchronous coding style making for faster code to manage concurrency while avoiding multithreaded problems.
* Thirdly, because of its popularity, JavaScript offers NodeJS acces to many useful libraries.
* And of course, NodeJS provides us the ability to share code between browser and server since they both use JavaScript code. Based on this, developers have created the MEAN stack, an all-JavaScript web application stack consisting of MongoDB (a database controlled by JavaScript), Express, Angular (a front-end JavaScript framework) and NOdeJS. Using JavaScript everywhere is a major benefit od NodeJS. In fact, there is also a MERN stack where insted of using Angular, React is used as the front end.

In this chapter we understood how a request and respond cycle between a client and server works by coding and starting up a simple server example. We handled requests and responded appropriately whit both text and HTML.
